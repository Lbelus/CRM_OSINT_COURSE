**Legacy Financial Solutions**

### Introduction:
Meet Sophie, a senior software engineer at **Legacy Financial Solutions**, a forward-thinking company focused on creating digital solutions for the modern banking experience. Sophie has recently been placed in charge of leading the development of a new mobile banking app. The company is eager to establish itself in the fast-evolving mobile banking market, and Sophie is under pressure to make important decisions regarding the app’s features and release schedule.

### Background:
**Legacy Financial Solutions** aims to launch an innovative mobile banking app that provides users with an intuitive and comprehensive experience. However, time is of the essence, as competitors are moving fast. Sophie must steer the development team through the challenge of finding a balance between delivering a fully functional product and releasing the app quickly to seize market opportunities.

### Key Players:

- **Sophie**: A seasoned software engineer leading the project.
- **Legacy Financial Management**: Focused on capturing market share quickly with an early release.
- **Product Manager**: Advocates for building a robust app with diverse features to stand out from the competition.

### The Dilemma:
Sophie faces a tough decision: on one side, the **Product Manager** is pushing for the inclusion of advanced features such as:

- Personal financial management tools
- Integration with third-party financial apps
- Mobile check deposits using images
- A rewards system linked to partner programs
- Two-factor authentication for secure online transactions

On the other side, **Management** is focused on getting a basic version of the app out as soon as possible with essential functionalities such as:

- Account overview and balance checking
- Fund transfers and incoming/outgoing wire transfers
- Basic transaction history
- Monthly statements
- User profile and security settings

Sophie must determine how to balance the company’s goal of a quick release with the need to ensure a high-quality product. She has one year to develop the application and manage expectations from both sides.

### Discussion Points:
- What approach should Sophie take to balance the demands of Management and the Product Manager?
- What are the critical, non-negotiable features that Sophie should prioritize to meet both time and quality expectations?
- How should Sophie structure the project timeline and define key milestones to ensure the app is delivered on time?
- Can the team employ an iterative development process, allowing them to refine the app based on user feedback while maintaining momentum?
- What criteria should Sophie use when defining the target product and deciding which features to prioritize?
- How can Sophie balance user-centric design with the company’s business needs to create a competitive product?
- What are the pros and cons of adopting an agile or lean development methodology in this context?
- How should Sophie align the development team’s goals with the expectations of the stakeholders, including Management and the Product Manager?
